    "text": "At Pavithra Stories, we believe photography is more than images — it is memory, emotion, and legacy. Every wedding is unique, every couple has a story, and every moment deserves to be preserved with authenticity.\n\nOur approach is simple yet powerful: observe quietly, feel deeply, and capture truthfully. From the nervous smiles before the ceremony to the laughter that follows, we document moments as they naturally unfold.\n\nWith a deep respect for traditions, cultures, and emotions, we blend creativity with storytelling to create photographs and films that feel real — today, tomorrow, and forever."
